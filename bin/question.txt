I need two Java programs combined (intelligently and correctly). Below are two Java programs. 
The first one displays a jpeg image on the screen. The other one resizes a jpeg image. 
I need these two programs to be combined into 1 Java Program so that 4 images can be resized and displayed on the screen simultaneously. 
Each image would take 1/4th (25%) of the screen area. In total all 4 images must fill the screen. 
Also I need the program to prompt for the location of the images using a file chooser. (it cannot stay hard-coded as it is now in the examples). 
The screen dimensions must be automatically detected and the program window maximized to full screen. 
The image parameters must be detected from the JPEG.
